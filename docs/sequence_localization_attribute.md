# Slot: sequence_localization_attribute


An attribute that can be applied to a workload sequence localization edge. These edges connect a workload entity such as an daemon to an entity such as a container. Edge properties are used to ascribe specific positional information and other metadata to the localization. In pragmatic terms this can be thought of as columns in a GFF3 line.
