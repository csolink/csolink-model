## Parents

 *  is_a: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md) - a databased entity or concept/class

## Uses Mixins

 *  mixin: [ExposureEvent](ExposureEvent.md) - A (possibly time bounded) incidence of a feature of the environment of an organism that influences one or more phenotypic features of that organism, potentially mediated by genes

## Referenced by class

 *  **[SequenceVariantModulatesTreatmentAssociation](SequenceVariantModulatesTreatmentAssociation.md)** *[sequence variant modulates treatment association➞object](sequence_variant_modulates_treatment_association_object.md)*  <sub>REQ</sub>  **[Treatment](Treatment.md)**
 *  **[DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature](DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature.md)** *[treated by](treated_by.md)*  <sub>0..*</sub>  **[Treatment](Treatment.md)**

## Attributes


### Own

 * [has device](has_device.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an entity to one or more (medical) devices
    * range: [Device](Device.md)
 * [has drug](has_drug.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an entity to one or more drugs
    * range: [Drug](Drug.md)
 * [has procedure](has_procedure.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an entity to one or more (medical) procedures
    * range: [Procedure](Procedure.md)

### Inherited from entity:

 * [id](id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [iri](iri.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.
    * range: [IriType](types/IriType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
 * [category](category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the csolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a csolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the csolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `bl:Protein`, `bl:GeneProduct`, `bl:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific csolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in csolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in csolink. Here we would have categories {bl:GenomicEntity, bl:MolecularEntity, bl:NamedThing}
    * range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [type](type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [name](name.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
 * [description](description.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a human-readable description of an entity
    * range: [NarrativeText](types/NarrativeText.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [source](source.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a lightweight analog to the association class 'has provider' slot, which is the string name, or the authoritative (i.e. database) namespace, designating the origin of the entity to which the slot belongs.
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [provided by](provided_by.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group) that provided it
    * range: [Agent](Agent.md)
 * [has attribute](has_attribute.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects any entity to an attribute
    * range: [Attribute](Attribute.md)
    * in subsets: (samples)

### Inherited from exposure event:

 * [timepoint](timepoint.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a point in time
    * range: [TimeType](types/TimeType.md)

### Inherited from named thing:

 * [named thing➞category](named_thing_category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
