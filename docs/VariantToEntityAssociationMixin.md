## Mixin for

 * [VariantToDiseaseAssociation](VariantToDiseaseAssociation.md) (mixin) 
 * [VariantToGeneAssociation](VariantToGeneAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An association between a variant and a gene, where the variant has a genetic association with the gene (i.e. is in linkage disequilibrium)
 * [VariantToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation](VariantToPhenotypicFeatureAssociation.md) (mixin) 
 * [VariantToPopulationAssociation](VariantToPopulationAssociation.md) (mixin)  - An association between a variant and a population, where the variant has particular frequency in the population
