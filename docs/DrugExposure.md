## Parents

 *  is_a: [Drug](Drug.md) - A substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease

## Uses Mixins

 *  mixin: [ExposureEvent](ExposureEvent.md) - A (possibly time bounded) incidence of a feature of the environment of an organism that influences one or more phenotypic features of that organism, potentially mediated by genes

## Children

 * [DrugToGeneInteractionExposure](DrugToGeneInteractionExposure.md) - drug to gene interaction exposure is a drug exposure is where the interactions of the drug with specific genes are known to constitute an 'exposure' to the organism, leading to or influencing an outcome.

## Attributes


### Inherited from drug:

 * [has active ingredient](has_active_ingredient.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: one or more chemical substance which are the active ingredient(s) of a drug
    * range: [ChemicalSubstance](ChemicalSubstance.md)
 * [has excipient](has_excipient.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: one or more (generally inert) chemical substances which are formulated alongside the active ingredient of a drug
    * range: [ChemicalSubstance](ChemicalSubstance.md)

### Inherited from entity:

 * [id](id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [iri](iri.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.
    * range: [IriType](types/IriType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
 * [category](category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the csolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a csolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the csolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `bl:Protein`, `bl:GeneProduct`, `bl:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific csolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in csolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in csolink. Here we would have categories {bl:GenomicEntity, bl:MolecularEntity, bl:NamedThing}
    * range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [type](type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [name](name.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A human-readable name for an attribute or entity.
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
 * [description](description.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a human-readable description of an entity
    * range: [NarrativeText](types/NarrativeText.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [source](source.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a lightweight analog to the association class 'has provider' slot, which is the string name, or the authoritative (i.e. database) namespace, designating the origin of the entity to which the slot belongs.
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [provided by](provided_by.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group) that provided it
    * range: [Agent](Agent.md)
 * [has attribute](has_attribute.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects any entity to an attribute
    * range: [Attribute](Attribute.md)
    * in subsets: (samples)

### Inherited from exposure event:

 * [timepoint](timepoint.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: a point in time
    * range: [TimeType](types/TimeType.md)

### Inherited from mixture:

 * [has constituent](has_constituent.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: one or more chemical substances within a mixture
    * range: [ChemicalSubstance](ChemicalSubstance.md)

### Inherited from named thing:

    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)

### Inherited from thing with taxon:

 * [in taxon](in_taxon.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an entity to its taxonomic classification. Only certain kinds of entities can be taxonomically classified; see 'thing with taxon'
    * range: [OrganismTaxon](OrganismTaxon.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
