#
# CURIE namespaces (prefixes/base URI's) mappings of prefixes used in the body of the Csolink Model specification
# are resolved using a specific precedence order, for use in the generation of the Csolink Model context.jsonld
# mappings to namespaces. Any prefixes encountered in the Csolink Model but not resolved by the following
# precedence sources, are anonymously declared by biolinkml as http://example.org/UNKNOWN/ rooted base URI's
# which should ideally be repaired in one of the precedence lists.

# 1. The following 'prefixes:' delimited list has first precedence in resolution.

      - Should be implemented as a stronger type

  category type:
    typeof: uriorcurie
    description: >-
      A primitive type in which the value denotes a class within the csolink model.
      The value must be a URI or a CURIE. In a Neo4j representation, the value should
      be the CURIE for the csolink class, for example csolink:Service. For an RDF representation,
      the value should be a URI such as https://w3id.org/csolink/vocab/Service

  iri type:
    typeof: uriorcurie
    description: >-
      An IRI

  label type:
    typeof: string
    description: >-
      A string that provides a human-readable name for an entity

  predicate type:
    typeof: uriorcurie
    description: >-
      A CURIE from the csolink related_to hierarchy.
      For example, csolink:related_to, csolink:causes, csolink:treats.

  narrative text:

          alternate CURIE otherwise. Enclosing publications (i.e. referenced by
          'published in' node property) such as books and journals, should have
          industry-standard identifier such as from ISBN and ISSN.
